Hello and welcome to my Github pages. This repository contains a tool named **SecureChest**. The aim of this tool is to provide a CLI "secured" chest for password storage like Keepass or Bitwarden. I have chosen to develop it in Golang because it gives the possibility to build an executable for differents operating systems and allow me to train on differents programming languages. Below you can find a non-exhaustive list of developed features :

- Access to the password manager with a master password

- Add an entry to the password manager

- Show an entry for a targeted service

- Delete an entry

- Copy the password of a targeted service on the clipboard
